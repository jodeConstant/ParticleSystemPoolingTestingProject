# ParticleSystemPoolingTestingProject
Unity project used for "Comparing performances between different methods of using large numbers of ParticleSystem effects in Unity games on Android OS"

## Some general notes

- Same scene was reused for all builds, with adjustments and changes to script component / object behaviour. In hindsight, it would probably be better to have a scene for each test run in the project and include one of them for each build.
- All 3 extra allocations script was added to a single game object; those were removed later to redo some earlier test

SINCE THIS CONTAINS RESULTS OF A STUDY, THIS REPOSITORY WILL REMAIN ARCHIVED
